# User Guide

This is the guide to using the website used to control the Adaptive plugin.
To start, you must login with Facebook / Google. From there you will be directed
to a page to create new styles for the plugin. This will lead you to a control panel
you can use to set the appropriate styles and experiment with various features.
For your new style to take effect, you must mark it as the default style in
your home page. You can also look at others users styles by going to the public styles page.

## Style Control Panel:
The panel is broken up into several parts:
* **Style information**. This is where you set basic information about your style such as
  the title and any tags you may want to add.
* **Color manipulations**. Here you can change the brightness and contrast of webpages, as well as
  being able to apply filters to make webpages more accessible to certain types of color blindness.
* **Paragraph reader**. This panel lets you control a feature that will read paragraphs for you, highlighting each word as you go along. This is particularly useful for people with dyslexia.
* **Mouse control**. Mouse control allows you to add delays to mouse clicks. This could be useful for people with
  hand tremors.
* **Link highlighting** can allow you to highlight links to see them more easily.
* **Extra tools** contains a bunch of extra stuff that might be fun to experiment with! In particular, there is an *auto captioning* features that will use machine learning to automatically label images (useful for screen readers).
