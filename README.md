# Adaptive - Backend Laravel Project

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/HarriBellThomas/adaptive-php.svg?token=zdqxmjKjYitf3HJEzgrp&branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/HarriBellThomas/adaptive-php)

This is the code for our hosted platform used to manipulate, share and store styles.
It has two major components:
* The backend code, written in PHP for the Laravel framework.
* The React app, used to create and edit styles in an intuitive way.

## Backend:
This includes:
* The database schema (src/database/migrations)
* Models (src/app)
* Controllers (src/app/Http/Controllers)
* Routes (src/routes)
* Views (src/views)

## React app:
The component classes, used to generate a JavaScript file (src/public/js/app.js) can be found in
src/resources/assets/js/components.
